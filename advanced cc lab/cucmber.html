    <p> Wanna chat about flow? Tell a fella, "Come see me"

        Boy, you know I'm magic on the mic, Houdini <br>

        Can't work out how I flow so <a href="https://www.instagram.com/freely/?hl=en" target="_blank" >freely</a>

        Puffin' that whirly, oh, so cheesy <br>

        Lovin' up the marijuana <br>

        I ain't worried about him, boy, the chav is a 'nana <br> 

        Give a fuck about a deal, tell him, "Grab me a lager"

        I be on the back wheel like I'm Travis Pastrana (Ring ding)

        I don't use my brain, girl, I use me knob

        So drop down, get low, gotta loosen off

        I'm startin' to really get the pox with this lockdown shit about 3.0 (I'm gonna lose me job)
        Like (Oh), chavvy, I'm lit

        I go and write a full song while I'm havin' a shit
        Stayin' in me own lane, I don't follow the drip
        I treat the fanny like a speedball, pummel the clit
        I treat the fanny like a punchbag, roughin' it up
        She let mе stick in in her ringer, yeah, I doublеd it up (Get it?)
        Don't you know the government are locking us up?
        So why the fuck you tryna act like you're up in the club? (Go to bed)
        Make 'em bounce to the rhythm of the beat real quick
        Girl, show me how you do it, on your feet real slick
        Cuttin' down on the couva, better know I still sniff
        Done a bag, now they tell me, I Am Legend, Will Smith
        Done a bag, now I'm runnin' through the woods like Mowgli
        If you ain't ringin' up for the Kush, don't phone me
        Fatty here puffin' on a blunt, while I'm touchin' up her cunt
        Boy, I'm 'bout to slam dunk like Kobe
        Lay up off the couva boy, smashin' up me brain
        Took an L, bounced back and now I'm back up in the game
        I just give them all a blast, I don't even know her name
        Transferred a twenty bar, told the cunt to get the train

        I tell her touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
        I'Il give it to ya just how you like it, darl'
        Puff this cheesy, make it look easy
        Whip out the pen, start writing (Whip it)
        Whip out the pen, start writing (Whip it)
        Whip out the pen, start writing
        And if a man talk shit, boy, l'll jab him up the lip
        Yeah, I'II make a man quit like Tyson
        
        [Verse 2]
        Yeah, magic on the mic, boy, you better believe it
        Got the abracadabra, the telekinesis
        Ain't gettin' on the couva then I tell her to leave it
        No pics on the sesh, right, tell her "Delete it"
        Tell her "don't fuck about, get straight to the point"
        Cup of tea, two sugars, bit of steak and a joint
        Watch her pull up in the vest, looking like a Big Lez
        While I get the stinging, Roger and I get the (Popcoin)
        Tell her get the stinging Roger while I'm puffin' on the Benson
        Keep your mooey shut, I ain't the one that you can mention
        Best in the game, better stay in your lane
        Every time they say my name, boy, you know they feel tension
        Got her legs spread wide and she letting me lick it
        She wanna suck me left bollock, yeah she very specific
        Ain't nobody give it to ya, gotta get up and get it
        And ain't no couva 'til 12, 'cause l've done all me limit
        
        
        [Chorus]
        I tell her touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
        I'II give it to ya just how you like it, darl'
        Puff this cheesy, make it look easy
        Whip out the pen, start writing (Whip it)
        Whip out the pen, start writing (Whip it)
        Whip out the pen, start writing
        And if a man talk shit, boy, I'll jab him up the lip
        Yeah, I'II make a man quit like Tyson
        I tell her touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
        I'll give it to ya just how you like it, darl'
        Puff this cheesy, make it look easy
        Whip out the pen, start writing (Whip it)
        Whip out the pen, start writing (Whip it)
        Whip out the pen, start writing
